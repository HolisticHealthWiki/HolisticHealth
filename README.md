Healthy habits, healthy rewards.

This project tackles chronic disease management by turning remote monitoring into a game. Patients earn points and rewards for logging vital signs, completing health tasks, and staying consistent. A simple chatbot provides reminders and motivation. For additional support, patients can add a guardian to verify tracking. Doctors can also tailor the experience by adding specific requirements for each patient, further personalizing the game and potentially improving health outcomes.
