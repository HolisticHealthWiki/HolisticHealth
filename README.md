Healthy habits, healthy rewards.

This project tackles chronic disease management by turning remote monitoring into a game. Patients earn points and rewards for logging vital signs, completing health tasks, and staying consistent.  A simple chatbot provides reminders and motivation. This solution aims to boost patient engagement, leading to better adherence and improved health outcomes.
